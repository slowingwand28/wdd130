                        <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most 
                        desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty 
                        Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert 
                        scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile 
                        trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green 
                        River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
                        formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, 
                        and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class 
                        II/III and is usually done in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been 
                        recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on 
                        the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>

                        <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all 
                        river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with 
                        breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river 
                        experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                        whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins 
                        accessible only by river. CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon 
                        uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon 
                        are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a 
                        wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most 
                        people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating 
                        scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
